Day2:

Today I have newly learned some Html tags and css selectors.

I have create a site by using all html input tags and all the elements.

CSS selctors are:
        * Id selectors      
        * Class selectors
        * Element selector
        * Attribute selectors

Some css properties:
            *nth chid selectors
            *padding
            *margin
